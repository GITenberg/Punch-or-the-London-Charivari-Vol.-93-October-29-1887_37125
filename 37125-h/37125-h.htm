<h2>QUITE A LITTLE HOLIDAY.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Extract from a Grand Old Diary. Monday, Oct. 17.</span></p>

<p>Self, wife, and <span class="sc">Herbert</span> started early to escape our kind-hearted,
clear-headed admirers; so early, that I scarcely had time before
leaving to write thirty post-cards, seventy-six pages of notes for my
next magazine article, and to cut down half-a-dozen trees. Train
announced to leave Chester at
10:30, but got off at the hour.
This little joke (<span class="sc">Watkin&#8217;s</span>
notion) caused much amusement.
Through opera-glasses we could
see bands of music, deputations,
&amp;c., constantly coming to the
railway-stations to meet our train
after it had passed. Too bad!
However, to prevent disappointment,
and as <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> has
been imitating me and vulgarised
my original idea, I knocked off
some speeches, in pencil, and
<span class="sc">Herbert</span> threw them out of the
window as fast as I could write
them. So far as we could make
out with a telescope, some of
them reached their destination,
and seemed to be well received.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:23%;">
<a href="images/193.png"><img width="100%" src="images/193.png" alt="Master Willie Gladstone" /></a>
<p>Master Willie Gladstone &ldquo;really enjoying,
and in some measure appreciating
and understanding,&rdquo; our
Mr. Agnew&#8217;s lectures on Art.</p>
<p><i>Vide Times Report, Oct. 18.</i></p></div>

<p>Awfully pleased to meet Mr.
<span class="sc">William Agnew</span> at Manchester.
Odd coincidence of Christian
names. I shall speak of him
and allude to him as &ldquo;The Other
<span class="sc">William</span>.&rdquo; He promised to keep
by me, and show me all the pictures
worth seeing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;T&#8217;Other <span class="sc">William</span>,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;you are very good. As you
know, I take a great and sincere
interest in pictures and works of Art, although I know very little
about them.&rdquo; T&#8217;Other <span class="sc">William</span> protested. &ldquo;No, T&#8217;Other <span class="sc">William</span>,
I am right. You have been the means of providing me with a commodity
most difficult of all others to procure if you do not possess it
yourself&mdash;that is to say, you have provided me with brains.&rdquo;
Further protests from T&#8217;Other One. &ldquo;No, T&#8217;Other <span class="sc">William</span>, hear
me out; for you know in all cases where a judgment has had to be
passed upon works of Art, I have been accustomed to refer a great
deal to you, and lean upon you, because you have been constantly the
means of enabling me really to see, and really to enjoy, and in some
measure to appreciate and understand, all that you have shown to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was so pleased with this little speech that I made <span class="sc">Herbert</span> take
it down as I repeated it to him privately when T&#8217;Other was looking
in another direction. When I brought it out afterwards, at luncheon
in the Palm-house, it went wonderfully. So it should, because I felt
every word of it. T&#8217;Other <span class="sc">William</span> is one of the kindest and most
courteous of my friends.</p>

<p>I was very pleased with the Exhibition, although perhaps (I am
not certain of this) I might have seen it better had not about
four thousand visitors followed our little party everywhere, cheering
vociferously. I was consequently obliged to keep my attention most
carefully fixed upon the exhibits, as when I caught any stranger&#8217;s
eye, the stranger immediately (but with an eagerness that did not
exceed the limits of good behaviour) called upon me to make a speech
then and there upon the subject of &ldquo;Home Rule.&rdquo; I am sure I should
on each and every occasion have only been too delighted, had not Sir
<span class="sc">Andrew</span> warned me not to indulge too much in that sort of thing.
The crowd, however, had its decided advantage, inasmuch as we were
carried off our feet everywhere. In this luxurious fashion we were
wafted to Messrs. <span class="sc">Doulton&#8217;s</span> Pottery Manufactory, to Mr. <span class="sc">Jesse
Haworth&#8217;s</span> loan exhibition of Egyptian antiquities, the name
&ldquo;<span class="sc">Jesse</span>&rdquo; recalled to me the poor misguided <span class="sc">Joe&#8217;s</span> &ldquo;<span class="sc">Jesse</span>,&rdquo; the
second fiddle, but <i>toujours fidèle</i>, and to a great many other shows
of almost equal interest.</p>

<p>But of course <i>the</i> feature of the Exhibition was the collection of
pictures. I was absolutely delighted. T&#8217;Other <span class="sc">William</span> explained
everything, and amongst other portraits showed me one of myself by
<span class="sc">Millais</span>. I imagine that everybody must have thought it very like,
because when they observed me inspecting it, they cheered more
vigorously than ever. For my part I can&#8217;t help feeling that Sir
<span class="sc">John</span> might have done more with the collars. He has not (to my
thinking, although I confess I may be wrong) put quite enough
starch in them. This is my own idea, as I did not consult T&#8217;Other
One upon the subject. Great as my reliance is upon him concerning
works of Art, I reserve the right of using my own judgment in the
matter of collars. Passing through the galleries I was delighted
with everything I saw. The only drawback to my pleasure was the
fact that I was followed (as I have already hinted) by a cheering
crowd, who occasionally, and, no doubt, accidentally, drowned the
voice of my kind Mentor. Under other circumstances I should have
drawn the distinction between the Mentor and the Tor-mentors.
Think this, but don&#8217;t say it. For instance, when we were standing
in front of &ldquo;<i>Ramsgate Sands</i>,&rdquo; this is what reached my ears eager
for instruction:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Ramsgate Sands</i>,&rsquo; by <span class="sc">Frith</span>&mdash;(<i>&lsquo;Hooray!&rsquo;</i>)&mdash;who, as you know,
has just written&mdash;(<i>&lsquo;Speech! Speech!&rsquo; &lsquo;Home Rule!&rsquo; &lsquo;Three
cheers for <span class="sc">Morley</span>!&rsquo;</i>)&mdash;full of anecdotes of all sorts of interesting
people. If you went to Ramsgate now, you would find&mdash;&mdash;(<i>&lsquo;We
are going to give you another carpet, old man!&rsquo; &lsquo;Hooray, hooray,
hooray!&rsquo; &lsquo;Three Cheers for Home Rule!&mdash;An extra one for
Manchester!&rsquo;</i>)&mdash;and practically the sand-frequenters we are carefully
examining in this picture are of thirty years ago. (<i>&lsquo;Speech!
Speech!&rsquo;</i>) You must know&mdash;&mdash;(<i>&lsquo;Hooray, hooray, hooray!&rsquo;</i>)&rdquo;</p>

<p>And at this period my dear friend was silenced by our being
carried away in an irresistible stream to the Palm-house, where we
took part in an excellent luncheon. Here I delivered my speech,
which I pride myself was first-rate. I called Manchester the
Modern Athens, explaining, however, that no offence was intended
to the capital of Midlothian. Take it all round, then, in spite of the
&ldquo;exuberant interest&rdquo; shown in me by my fellow-citizens, I have
had a very pleasant day, thanks chiefly to T&#8217;Other <span class="sc">William</span>.</p>

<h2>A PROGRESSIVE PROGRAMME.</h2>

<p><i>October 25.</i>&mdash;Lecture by amiable Police Magistrate to six hulking
rowdies, who have been assaulting the Police, on the duty of &ldquo;bearing
distress patiently.&rdquo; Tells them &ldquo;not to do it again,&rdquo; and dismisses
them with aid from the Poor Box and his blessing. Surprise
of rowdies.</p>

<p><i>October 26.</i>&mdash;Unemployed employ themselves in sacking portion of
Bond Street, during temporary withdrawal of Police for a little rest.</p>

<p><i>October 27.</i>&mdash;Sitting Alderman at Mansion House gives a Socialist
Deputation some sympathetic and fatherly advice, and recommends
them to &ldquo;study laws of supply and demand.&rdquo; Invites them to
Lord Mayor&#8217;s Banquet. Deputation accepts invitation readily, and,
on emerging into street, is chivied down Cheapside by infuriated
mob of other Socialists, who have not received invitations.</p>

<p><i>October 28.</i>&mdash;New Leaders of Mob (<i>vice</i> Deputation, resigned)
denounce sympathetic Alderman as a &ldquo;bloated exploiter.&rdquo; Nelson
Monument pulled down. Ten leading tradesmen, in neighbourhood
of Trafalgar Square, unable to do any business, owing to streets
being blocked with rioters, go into bankruptcy.</p>

<p><i>October 29.</i>&mdash;Gathering of &ldquo;Unemployed&rdquo; in Westminster Abbey.
Unemployed complain bitterly because chairs have no cushions. The
Dean, conducted to pulpit under strong police escort, preaches very
conciliatory sermon on duty of Upper Classes, all, except Deans, to
give most of what they possess to poor; advises poor to wait
patiently till they get it. Retires under heavy shower of hymn-books.
Unemployed &ldquo;remain to prey.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>October 30.</i>&mdash;Westminster Abbey sacked, in consequence of Dean&#8217;s
conciliatory sermon. The Canons go off.</p>

<p><i>November 1.</i>&mdash;Mansion House Relief Fund started. Fifty thousand
pounds subscribed the first day by leading philanthropists who
have had all their windows broken. Trade paralysed, and numbers
of Unemployed consequently increasing. Speech by celebrated
Statesman, contrasting disorder and lawlessness in Ireland with universal
contentment and order existing in England.</p>

<p><i>November 2.</i>&mdash;Mob helps itself to chief pictures in National
Gallery, on ground that they &ldquo;belong to the people.&rdquo; Raffle organised
for the Raffaelles. Fifteen policemen have their ribs broken.</p>

<p><i>November 3.</i>&mdash;Whole Police Force disabled by angry mob armed
with bludgeons and revolvers. Sympathetic Alderman at Mansion
House ventures to ask Government if &ldquo;matters are not really going
a little too far,&rdquo; and is ducked in Thames. All the West-End
shops in-wested by looters.</p>

<p><i>November 4.</i>&mdash;Prime Minister declares that &ldquo;much as he regrets
the depression of trade and want of employment, yet he thinks that
on the whole, recent proceedings have not been quite creditable to
Capital City of Empire.&rdquo; Military called out, and streets cleared in
no time. Ringleaders of mob arrested, and given a year&#8217;s imprisonment
with hard labour. Trafalgar Square railed round and planted
with prickly cactus. Business resumed and confidence restored.
Government begins to think of a Bill to deal with <i>real</i> London
grievances&mdash;such as rack-rents, slum-dwellings, and foreign pauper
labour. <span class="stage">[<i>And high time too!</i></span></p>

<hr />

<p><span class="sc">A Cloud of Yachts.</span>&mdash;The account of the British owner published
last week, confirms the notion that the much-talked-of superiority
of the <i>Thistle</i> over the <i>Volunteer</i> was mere vapouring. This is not
surprising. All that could be appropriately expected from such a
weed was smoke!</p>

<hr />

<h2>THE NEW QUIXOTE.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Fragments from a forthcoming Romance of (Political) Chivalry and
(Party) Knight-Errantry.</i></p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The age of our gentleman bordered upon fifty years. He was of
a strong constitution, spare-bodied, of a keen, not to say hatchet-like
visage, a very early (and rapid) riser, and a lover of the orchid.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>His judgment being somewhat obscured, he was seized with one of
the strangest fancies that ever entered the head of any naturally
astute person. This was a belief that it behoved him, as well for the
advancement of his own glory as the service of his country, to become
a knight-errant (though, indeed, there was, perhaps, about him more
of the errant than the knightly), and traverse the northern parts of
Hibernia, armed and mounted, in quest of adventures, redressing
every species of grievance save such as were not found in his own list,
or &ldquo;programme,&rdquo; which latter, indeed, he would by no means admit
to be &ldquo;grievances&rdquo; at all. The poor gentleman imagined himself
to be at least crowned Autocrat of Orangeia by the valour of his
arm; and thus wrapt in these agreeable illusions, and borne away
by the extraordinary pleasure he found in them, he hastened to put
his design into execution.</p>

<p>The first thing he did was to scour up some rusty armour which
had done service in the time of his great-grandfather, and had lain
many years neglected in a corner. This he cleaned and furbished
up as well as he could, but he found one great defect&mdash;it would not
in any part stand one stroke from modern steel, much less one shot
from modern gun. However, as he was rather fired with the yearning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg 195]</span>
to attack than impressed with the necessity for defence, this
deficiency troubled him but little.</p>

<p>In the next place he visited his steed, which though but a hobby
of wooden aspect and no paces, yet in his eyes it surpassed any
charger that the Achilles of Hawarden ever bestrode, or the
Automedon of Derby ever handled. Many days was he deliberating
upon what name he should give it; for, as he said to himself, it
would be very improper that a horse so excellent appertaining to a
Knight so famous should be without an appropriate name; he therefore
endeavoured to find one that should express what he had been
before he belonged to a knight-errant, and also what he now was;
nothing could, indeed, be more reasonable than that, when the
master changed his state, the horse should likewise change his name,
and assume one pompous and high-sounding, as became the new
order he now professed. Failing in this endeavour, he called his
hobby, provisionally at least, <i>Ne Plus Ulster</i>, a name which if it
suggested a sorry joke, was so far fitting that it was bestowed upon
a sorry nag.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In the meantime our knight-errant had brought his persuasive
powers to bear upon a humble labourer in the fields which he himself
had lately left, a neighbour of his, some said of his own distant kin,
and an honest man, but somewhat shallow-brained and self-important.
In short, he said so much, used so many arguments, that the poor
fellow resolved to sally out with him, and serve him in the capacity
of a Squire. Among other things, <span class="sc">Don Quixote</span> told him that he
ought to be very glad to accompany him, for such an adventure
might some time or the other occur, that, by one stroke, an Island
might be won, where it was within the bounds of possibility that he,
the Squire, might one day become Governor, or at least Viceroy.
With this and other promises <span class="sc">Sancho Panza</span> (for that was the
rustic&#8217;s name) left his well-beloved three acres at home, not to
name a favourite cow, for a time at least, and engaged himself as
Squire to his ambitious neighbour.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Engaged in friendly discourse, they came in sight of eighty-five
or eighty-six windmills; and as <span class="sc">Don Quixote</span> espied them he said to
his Squire, &ldquo;Fortune favours us. Look yonder, friend <span class="sc">Jesse</span>&mdash;I
mean <span class="sc">Sancho</span>&mdash;where thou mayest discover some more than eighty
disloyal giants, and monsters of sedition, whom I intend to encounter
and slay.&rdquo; &ldquo;What giants?&rdquo; said <span class="sc">Sancho Panza</span>. &ldquo;These
thou seest yonder,&rdquo; answered his master, &ldquo;with their long and far-reaching
arms, for some are wont to have them of the full length of
a league. Fly not, ye cowards, and vile caitiffs!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;for
it is a single Knight who assaults ye! Although ye should have
more arms than the giant Briareus, ye shall pay for it!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>And the story, so far as it has gone (it is &ldquo;to be continued&rdquo;),
leaves <span class="sc">Don Quixote</span> making a prodigiously plucky assault upon the
League-limbed &ldquo;giants,&rdquo; with what result the sequel will show.</p>

<h2>THE LETTER-BAG OF TOBY, M.P.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">From a Hooded Eagle.</span></p>

<p class="right"><i>H-tf-ld House, Friday.</i></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:56%;"><a href="images/196-1.png">
<img width="100%" src="images/196-1.png" alt="Hooded Eagle" /></a></div>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Toby</span>,</p>

<p>After a too brief holiday I
am back again to H-tf-ld and
to L-nd-n, and take an early
opportunity of dropping you a
line. I call the interval since the
House was up a holiday for
convenience sake; but what with
the daily arrival of despatch
boxes and the delivery of the
morning papers, the repose has
been intermittent. I fancy that
since the days of Old <span class="sc">Pam</span> the
recess has always been a mockery
for the Premier of the day. <span class="sc">D-zzy</span>
had some bad times from 1874 to
1880, and <span class="sc">Gl-dst-ne&#8217;s</span> subsequent
Premiership was not a bed of
roses, even in the recess. But
they at least had the satisfaction
of feeling that they were in power
as well as in office. If they decided upon a particular line of policy, they could
initiate it without first inquiring how it might suit half-a-dozen people.
Moreover, each was in varying degree supported by capable colleagues, able to
hold their own on the platform or in the House. For unhappy Me things are
quite otherwise. I may devise a policy for Ireland and elsewhere, but before I
can announce it, I must humbly learn how it suits my Lord <span class="sc">H-rt-ngt-n</span> and
my good friend <span class="sc">Ch-mb-rl-n</span>. As for my colleagues and the help I receive from
them&mdash;&mdash;well, that is a matter of which of course I cannot write, even in the
confidence of correspondence with you. But I may tell you that over at Châlet
C-c-l I found some little time for reading other literature than Blue Books.
Looking through <span class="sc">Shelley</span> once again, I came upon the line descriptive of
<span class="sc">Coleridge</span>, &ldquo;flagging wearily through darkness and despair,&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;A hooded eagle among blinking owls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t exactly know why, but when I think of some things that have taken
place lately, I have a strong feeling of personal sympathy with the hooded eagle.</p>

<p>But this is a trifle melancholy, and will make you think I am in low spirits,
or even that there is truth in the newspaper rumours of failing health. Nothing
of the sort, dear boy; never better in my life. Full of health and spirits, of
hope for the coming time, and eagerness for the fray of next Session. How I
have envied <span class="sc">Gl-dst-ne</span> going about the country making speeches which would
have been twice as effective if they had been half as long, receiving the homage
of the masses, and driving in state through the streets of Derby, with his led
Captain, <span class="sc">H-rc-rt</span>, on the box-seat of his carriage! What a curious man is
<span class="sc">Gl-dst-ne</span>, the Elephant of our political life, who can in the morning crush
a Ministry, and in the afternoon achieve a petty economy by selling waste
timber. There has been a good deal written about <span class="sc">Napoleon</span> whilst involved in
his fatal campaign in Russia occupying spare moments in drawing up regulations
for the Opera House at Paris. But what is that compared with <span class="sc">Gl-dst-ne</span>
marching through the Midlands to upset my Government, and, <i>en route</i>, drafting
an announcement that timber felled at Hawarden by his own hand would be on
sale &ldquo;at a uniform charge, viz., 1<i>s.</i>, 6<i>d.</i> for a small log, or 3<i>s.</i> per cubic foot,
exclusive of railway carriage.&rdquo; Of course I know that <span class="sc">William Henry</span> has
gallantly rushed into the breach, and avowed the authorship of this remarkable
proclamation. But if W. H. is allowed to do this kind of thing without consultation
or authority, all I can say is that discipline at Hawarden is fatally
faulty. Besides, amiable and engaging as he is, I do not believe that W. H. is
equal to the unassisted concoction of this incomparable production. However it
be, no one but <span class="sc">Gl-dst-ne</span> could stand the ridicule of the
thing, and he doubtless doesn&#8217;t feel it.</p>

<p>How is <span class="sc">Gr-nd-lph</span> getting on? Not so well as he
used, I fancy. His new attitude of friendly neutrality
does not suit him, and is, moreover, not nearly so attractive
with the people as what I may call his Malayan
manner, when he used to run amuck at everybody,
including myself. It was a very dull speech he made at
Sunderland on Thursday. He must certainly wake up,
if he means to keep his old place. Perhaps he is, like
me, getting aweary of the whole thing, and wishes he
were well out of it. If I had my will, I would cut the
whole business, and spend my days and nights in the
laboratory here. But that cannot be, for the present at
least. So you will hear from me soon in the midst of the
fray; and, in the meantime, mind you understand that
I am in the best of spirits, confident in the present, and
hopeful for the future.</p>

<h2>PRO BONO PUBLICO.</h2>

<p>A Mob-Cap was once upon a time a picturesque finish to a pretty
face, and it was of home-manufacture. Now the Mob-Cap is a red
abomination, typical of bloodshed
and crime, of foreign make, and is
mis-called the Cap of Liberty,
which, properly translated, is the
Cap of Licence. It certainly is not
&ldquo;The Cap of Maintenance,&rdquo; as it is
adopted by those who would disdain
work, even if it were offered them.</p>

<p>Not for the first time has <i>Mr.
Punch</i> raised his voice against
Street Processions, which have developed
into one of the greatest
nuisances of the present time, destructive
of trade, detrimental to
every kind of regular business, and
a disgrace to our orderly and respectable
London. All processions
in London ought to be prohibited,
with the exception of such State,
Civic, or Ecclesiastical processions
as may be deemed essential to the dignity of authority, and which
have been, and still are, a source of real pleasure to the Londoners,
who dearly love a show, when there is due and proper occasion for it.</p>

<p>If the Salvationist Army processions, with their tambourines,
drums, and inharmonious bands, are permitted on Sunday (which
English people were wont to observe in peace and quietness), then
consistently a Socialist procession must be allowed. And what other
processions? Freemasons, Religious Guilds, Clubs,&mdash;why should not
the members of the Reform, the Athenæum, the Conservative, the
National Liberal, organise processions? Why not the Garrick Club,
headed by Mr. <span class="sc">Henry Irving</span> and Friend <span class="sc">Toole</span>, with banners emblazoned
with playbills? No. &ldquo;Reform it altogether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as to the liberty of out-of-door public meetings. Let
Trafalgar Square be explicitly forbidden to these mischievous anarchists,
of whom the majority are the dupes and tools of firebrand
foreign Communists. Let certain places be allotted to them for
&ldquo;airing their grievances,&rdquo; and let each of these places be at
least four miles distant from Charing-Cross. Our Parks are the
&ldquo;Lungs of London,&rdquo; and if these Lungs be congested, the health of
London will materially suffer. How many hundreds are now prevented
from entering the Parks by the fear of King Mob and his
rabble rout? Children and nursery-maids dare not take their recreation
in our Parks. Think of that, ye Privates of the Cavalry and
Infantry, and to a man you will be the first to declare for the freedom
of the Parks. Let one of the first enactments of the next Session be
a Bill to Regulate Processions and Out-of-door Meetings. Let it be a
liberal measure&mdash;in the true sense of liberal; that is, showing due
consideration for everybody&mdash;and let it come into operation as soon
as possible.</p>

<h2>KNIGHT THOUGHTS.</h2>

<p>Sir <span class="sc">Henry Knight</span> seems to be of opinion that luxurious living,
Aldermanic and otherwise, must be a good thing for the poor, because
&ldquo;Money spent in entertainment goes into the pockets of the working
classes.&rdquo; If that is so, Dives, in order to benefit Lazarus, can
hardly do better than go on faring sumptuously every day. And yet
somehow, as a matter of fact, the more Dives feeds the more Lazarus
famishes. How is this, O Knight of the Round (Dinner) Table?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither luxury, nor anything else,&rdquo; says the philosophical ex-Lord
Mayor, &ldquo;can be indulged in without purchasing the materials
which contribute to or from which the luxury is obtained.&rdquo; <i>Argal</i>,
the more luxury among the rich the more money in the pockets of
the poor. Cheering thought!&mdash;for civic <i>gourmands</i> and fashionable
fine ladies! Did not a great financier once suggest that England,
which fought itself into debt, might drink itself out of it? Here
seems to be a chance of eating ourselves out of poverty, of dining
ourselves out of destitution. Are there any real &ldquo;Unemployed&rdquo;
about? Let those who have money spend more of it in &ldquo;entertainments&rdquo;
and the problem is solved without recourse to Mansion
House Funds, Public Works, Eight Hour Movements, or other
schemes philanthropical or revolutionary.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Knight&#8217;s</span> panacea for poverty, this proposal to cure it by &ldquo;entertainment,&rdquo;
is certainly, in one sense, entertaining. But it is to be
feared that it can hardly be entertained.</p>

<h2>OUR ADVERTISERS.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Inverted Domestic and Other.</span></p>

<p>A GOOD PLAIN MISTRESS WANTED by a competent and
highly experienced Cook. Must be a thorough lady, accustomed
to making herself generally agreeable, and to not prying into household
matters which do not concern her. She will not be expected to
visit her own kitchen, inquire into the amount of her own weekly
books, keep the key of the beer, or object to the occasional visits of
members of the local Police Force, in which the advertiser has several
near relatives. A little dinner on a small scale now and then will
not be objected to, but seeing much company cannot for a moment
be entertained. An unexceptionable character from the three last
cooks who have filled the place, indispensable. Apply, M.B.

<p>TRAVELLING NOBLEMAN WANTED. A Courier who has a
slight acquaintance with the French and German languages,
and wishes to air them in the course of a pleasant and enjoyable little
outing, is desirous of meeting with a well-recommended aristocrat of
unquestionable antecedents, who wishes to visit the leading towns of
the Continent in thoroughly first-class style. The advertiser, who
would select the routes, generally direct the character of the tour,
and expect to have charge of the cheque-book, would stipulate that
under no circumstances should any question be raised on the score of
expense. None but Noblemen of a confiding disposition, that can be

figured prominently as a garrison hack, and has been somewhat
blown upon in consequence, she will not be too particular as to the
character of the particular &ldquo;Set&rdquo; into which her new surroundings
may introduce her; but as she has, by outliving her income, already
run through the little money she possessed, she will expect a salary
of not less than £100 a year, to enable her to dress up to the false
position she has in contemplation to occupy. No recognised old

<h2>FROM MR. HENRY IRVING&#8217;S NOTE-BOOK.</h2>

<p>(<i>Published without permission.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Stratford-on-Avon, October 18.</i>&mdash;Speech at the Opening-of-Fountain
ceremony went very well. Some distinguished Americans were not
there, notably Mr. <span class="sc">Abbey</span>. In consequence, had to omit all reference
to &ldquo;Abbey Thought&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fountains Abbey,&rdquo; which, as J. L. T.
suggested in his letter, would have lightened the entertainment considerably.
Also very annoying, but I never thought of it till too late;
I quite forgot to say anything about <span class="sc">Buffalo Bill</span>. <span class="sc">Cody</span> will be
hurt; but I shall be in America before he gets back there, so it doesn&#8217;t
much matter. Yet it was a chance lost. <span class="sc">William Shakspeare</span>,
<span class="sc">William Cody</span>, Buffalo <span class="sc">Bill</span>, Swan <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span>. No matter,
keep it for another time. And at the last moment I could not make
out what I had written on my wristband as a mem. for speech. It
was <i>à propos</i> of Mr. <span class="sc">Child&#8217;s</span> gift. I see now it was something about
&ldquo;Child&#8217;s the father to the man.&rdquo; And then an allusion to the sympathy
between America and England as not being mere &ldquo;Child&#8217;s-play.&rdquo;
Very odd, how I forgot that. Still, speech couldn&#8217;t have gone better.</p>

<p>And how on earth I omitted to make any mention of Miss <span class="sc">Mary
Anderson</span> I can&#8217;t understand! Yet the fact that this fair American
is now playing at the Lyceum ought to have stuck in my memory
which yet holds its seat in this distracted brain. And, dear me,
there was the American Minister present, and yet&mdash;bother it!&mdash;it
never occurred to me, till I was dressing this evening, hours afterwards,
that I ought to have remarked on the fact that America was
represented here on this special Dramatic occasion by a gentleman
bearing a name so honoured alike by English and American actors,
and so dear to the theatrical profession as must always be that of
&ldquo;<span class="sc">Phelps</span>.&rdquo; But this will keep, too, for another time. And, after
all, in spite of these omissions, which of course nobody noticed, the
speech went admirably.</p>

<h2>HINTS FOR THE UNEMPLOYED.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;Excellent as is the suggestion of your Correspondent, &ldquo;<span class="sc">One
who would Elevate Them</span>,&rdquo; that the Unemployed should be
forthwith put into the hands of some competent Ballet-Master, and
after a proper course of instruction, despatched to all the Board
Schools in England for the purpose of teaching every pupil who has
passed the Sixth Standard, dancing and deportment, yet I do not
think he goes far enough. Why stop at this comparatively subordinate
art? Why not make them musicians, teach them to play
<span class="sc">Wagner</span>, and despatch them straightway through the length and
breadth of the land as enthusiastic Apostles of the great Master?
What a glorious prospect to turn the three or four thousand idle
loafers who have lately been hulking about Trafalgar Square for the
purpose of breaking the peace, into a mighty army of skilled fiddlers
eager to wake the glad strains of the spirit-stirring Music of the
Future in every quiet village green through the three Kingdoms. And
the accomplishment of such a task need not be set aside as the wild
vision of some hopeless dreamer. I am convinced, Sir, that if the
authorities of the Royal College and Guildhall School of Music, but
set their shoulders to the wheel, the thing will soon be an accomplished
fact. Such, Sir, at all events, is the opinion of one who
believes firmly in</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">&ldquo;The Soul of the Masses.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;Why not paint the whole of London, public buildings and
all?&mdash;I&#8217;m sure they want it. The latter might be done in different
colours. St. Paul&#8217;s, for instance, might be orange, Westminster
Abbey pea-green, and the Houses of Parliament a bright blue. If
the effect were found unsatisfactory, fresh colours could be tried,
until something were hit upon that should be considered suitable.
This would afford the additional advantage of providing fresh work
for the Unemployed. I don&#8217;t see what else can be done. Everybody
can use a brush, and with a couple, or say, three coats all over the
Metropolis, there would be plenty to occupy everybody for the next
six months. As to expense, an extra 15<i>s.</i> tacked on to the rates
would soon settle that, and I&#8217;ll be bound there&#8217;s many a householder
willing to face that trifling alternative, together with</p>

<p class="center">Yours, practically, one who takes</p>
<p class="author"><span class="sc">&ldquo;The Bull by the Horns.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;I cannot but think that, if <span class="sc">Buffalo Bill</span> were to introduce
the &ldquo;Unemployed&rdquo; into his Show, he would score a big success.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg 203]</span>
The introduction might take the shape of a contest between the
&ldquo;Wild East&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Wild West.&rdquo; The former might be armed
with brickbats and park-railings, and the latter with their usual
weapons; and, were it known that a little genuine blood would be
drawn in the entertainment, it might be safely counted on to draw
all London. I throw out the suggestion for what it is worth.</p>

<p class="center">Your obedient servant,</p>
<p class="author"><span class="sc">&ldquo;A Commercial Well-wisher.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;As at the present season of the year nothing is more common
than to find the stalls of most of the leading West-End theatres
empty, a fact which has a very chilling effect on the efforts of the
players, why not fill the empty places with the so-called &ldquo;Unemployed&rdquo;?
A warm bath, a suit of evening clothes, clean shirt, and
white tie would instantly fit the veriest outcast that has recently
come into collision with the police in Hyde Park or elsewhere, at
least outwardly, for the social atmosphere of the place. A central
committee might at once be inaugurated for the supply of these
necessary preliminaries for admission, and a thousand or two excellent
substitutes for the ordinary <i>habitués</i> forthwith launched nightly
among what is at the present moment left of the fashionable play-going
world in the Metropolis. The advantage would cut both ways.
Not only would the Management be blessed by the appearance of a
perfectly full house, but the loafers, professional thieves, and ruffians
who produced it would, no doubt, endeavour to play up to their
clothes and surroundings, and, on receipt of a small retaining-fee of
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a head for their attendance, be proportionately softened and
civilised by the process. This, Sir, seems to me a very legitimate,
humane, and philosophical method of dealing with the present crisis,
and as such I trust it will as powerfully recommend itself to your
readers as it has to</p>

<p class="center">Yours thoughtfully,</p>
<p class="author"><span class="sc">&ldquo;A Pleasure-Seeking Socialist.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;What are the authorities about that they do not at once
embank the river on both sides up to Richmond, and span it with
five bridges between this and Gravesend? Then there&#8217;s the whole
of Piccadilly to come down and be rebuilt with the road properly
levelled, to say nothing of a great Central Terminus in Soho Square
uniting the Midland, North and Great Western, Great Northern with
the Great Eastern, and all the Great Southern lines. Add to this,
that the entire gas-piping of the Metropolis ought to come up
bodily, and make way for the installation of the Electric Light, to
say nothing of the fixing in all the leading thoroughfares of overhead
railways on the New York principle, and you have enough work
at least to begin upon and meet the present crisis. Let the Board of
Works and the various Vestries set to work at once, and as soon as
Parliament assembles let it be asked to vote Five-hundred Millions
towards preliminary expenses. This, Sir, is, I am convinced, the
only reasonable and efficient way of dealing with the present unsatisfactory
aspect of the labour question. Such is the opinion of</p>

<p class="center">Yours energetically,</p>
<p class="author"><span class="sc">&ldquo;A Roused Alarmist.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;When the Police have fairly and effectually cleared off the
loafers, not-do-a-stroke-of-work gentry, and the sedition-mongers,
then we can turn our attention to the wants of the genuine Unemployed.
Their case is by no means beyond us. It only needs the
active and intelligent co-operation among the administrators of
charitable funds and agencies, the Poor-Law Authorities, employers
of labour, and others, to give immediate and practical effect to the
wide-spread sympathy felt for them by all classes of their more fortunate
fellow-countrymen, including your quite sober-minded and
charitably-disposed Correspondent,</p>

<h2>THE ACTOR&#8217;S PROGRESS.</h2>

<p>Within the last half-century, the education of actors
has advanced in an extraordinary degree, inasmuch as
some have been known to take a degree, or try to, at
the University. Therefore the following advertisement
in the <i>Era</i> will probably cause little surprise:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
WANTED, for La Comédie Anglaise, a Light Comedian, for
a few Weeks, while a Member of the Company returns to
Oxford to take his degree. Must be a gentleman. Address, &amp;c.
</p></blockquote>

<p>This gentleman, to use the language of the <i>Era</i>, seems
inclined to &ldquo;combine leading business with general
utility.&rdquo; It is to be hoped he will get his degree, and
return to be an ornament to the stage. But if this
kind of thing goes on, we shall probably eventually see
announced in our theatrical contemporary&mdash;&ldquo;Senior
Wrangler and Light Comedian open to engagement in
first-class Company.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>STUDIES FROM MR. PUNCH&#8217;S STUDIO.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">No. XXX.&mdash;Mr. Alderman Slocoach.</span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width:32%;">
<a href="images/204-1.png"><img width="100%" src="images/204-1.png" alt="Mr. Alderman Slocoach." /></a></div>

<p>What a strange, unreal, almost incomprehensible life must that
of a City Alderman be at the present time. Regarded in the light of
centuries ago, it all seems in accordance with the fitness of things,
and neither ludicrous
nor out of place. But
now, in these days of
earnestness and common
sense, what a
great sham it seems to
the merely superficial
observer, and yet,
however great an anomaly
it may appear,
when tested by results
it seems to work fairly
well.</p>

<p>Suppose we take Mr.
Alderman <span class="sc">Slocoach</span> as
an example. He was
taken from his warehouse,
some years ago,
and made an Alderman
by the votes of some
three or four hundred
of the rate-payers of
his Ward, the majority
of whom knew little or
nothing about him, and
probably cared less,
and in a week or two,
he found himself
seated on the Magistrate&#8217;s
Bench at Guildhall,
to declare the
Law, of which he literally knew nothing, and to administer Justice
under circumstances so apparently absurd as to be hardly credible.
Being probably a conscientious man, and knowing his utter ignorance
of the duties that his position demanded of him, what was he to do?
What he did was probably the best he could do under the circumstances,
and thinking, as he told an old friend with whom he conversed
on the matter, that it was better, as err he must, to err on the side of
mercy, he made it a point always to consult the Clerk of the Court,
and whatever amount of punishment he advised him to inflict, he
generally halved it.</p>

<p>Having long since got thoroughly accustomed to the whole matter,
and having acquired a certain amount of dignity of demeanour, he is
able to go through the wondrous ceremony with comparative ease,
but is still greatly troubled with certain qualms of conscience in certain
special cases. For instance, when fining a poor working-man
five shillings for drunkenness,&mdash;he having met an old friend and
been persuaded to take more than was good for him,&mdash;and that
amount probably constituting a full day&#8217;s income, his thoughts will
revert to that particularly jovial banquet with his worshipful Company
the previous evening, and whether some one or two of the guests
not sufficiently seasoned to these matters, were not quite as guilty as
the poor workman he had just fined, and how they would like to have
to pay a day&#8217;s income for this folly, amounting in one case to probably
£100! and yet possibly the workman had the better excuse of
the two! And then, again, there is that very awkward and puzzling
question, that so troubles some of his more conscientious brethren as
well as himself, that of punishment for gambling. When inflicting
some of those very heavy fines and penalties, which he is told it is
his bounden duty to do in the case of betting in public houses, his
thoughts must revert to those two most intimate friends of his who
are regular visitors at <span class="sc">Tattersall&#8217;s</span> in the height of the racing season;
and also to the fact that he himself, as his stock-broker well knows,
after leaving the Bench, occasionally wends his way to Capel Court,
and buys or sells for the account to very very large amounts; and,
though he probably tries his best, as others do, to convince himself
that there is no doubt a very great difference between the cases of
Mr. <span class="sc">Bung</span> and Mr. <span class="sc">Tattersall</span>, and between playing cards for half-crowns,
and buying or selling £50,000 Consols for the account, it was
not until his conscience had lost its natural elasticity that he succeeded,
and, even now its twinges are, occasionally, very sharp.</p>

<p>When Alderman <span class="sc">Slocoach</span> was first elected to his high position,
his great delight was to attend at the Old Bailey, and occupy a seat
on the judicial Bench, and enjoy the supreme satisfaction of feeling
that, without his absolutely useless presence, the whole proceedings
must necessarily come to a stand-still, and fond memory still
looks back to the occasion on which one of Her <span class="sc">Majesty&#8217;s</span> Judges
actually said to him, in quite a friendly manner, &ldquo;Shall <i>we</i> say
twelve or fifteen months, Alderman?&rdquo; On the other hand, he will
probably remember, to his dying day, the look of mingled anger and
contempt with which he was received by another of Her <span class="sc">Majesty&#8217;s</span>
Judges, of rather irascible temper, when he rushed breathless into
Court, having, by his absence, delayed the proceedings for more than
an hour.</p>

<p>Naturally, the one particular event to which an Alderman looks
forward with the most especial anticipations of honour and renown,
is the year of his Mayoralty, when he will have his otherwise humble
name associated with those of the famous men who, in very different
times to those in which we live, ruled the great City, with courage
and discretion.</p>

<p>Much, however, depends upon the public events of his year of office,
as to its importance, or want of it, to himself personally, and Mr.
Alderman <span class="sc">Slocoach</span> was not particularly fortunate in that respect.
There was no European Monarch on a visit to this country, whom
the Corporation was requested by the Government to honour, with
the customary satisfactory result to the Lord Mayor of the day; there
was no public ceremonial of unusual importance that required the
brilliant surroundings of Civic pomp to give it full <i>éclat</i>, and as his
year of office approached its termination, his solemn look became
more solemn, and his hopes evidently grew fainter and fainter. But
fortune was kind to him, and a change of Government, which made
it desirable to gain the City&#8217;s sweet voices, brought him the coveted
honour.</p>

<p>Like most of his colleagues who have what is technically called
&ldquo;passed the Chair,&rdquo; he takes things very coolly, probably thinking
that nothing remains to be done after having passed through such an
ordeal. But there is one especial duty still left for Aldermen to
perform from which he is seldom absent. They have been deprived
of their control over prisons, and of their government of the Royal
Hospitals, their control of the Police is almost nominal, but they still
have charge of City Lunatics, and it is said that Alderman <span class="sc">Slocoach</span>
is seldom absent from the official visits to them, when the reciprocity
of feeling manifested between the poor patients and their visitor is
described as quite touching. He is also often seen at City Banquets,
and is always quite ready to return thanks for what he calls the
Grand Old Corporation, and repeats with painful iteration the old bit
of twaddle about the infallibility of Aldermanic judgments and the
increasing popularity of their order; but he is wonderfully good-natured,
devotes a great deal of time to the gratuitous performance
of public duties, assists very efficiently in brightening up many an
otherwise dull scene with the brilliancy of his handsome scarlet robe,
and would, with his worshipful Brethren, be much missed if deprived
of those civic functions that have been performed by them, and such
as they, for many centuries past, and which entitle them in all
respects to the esteem of their fellow citizens as a trustworthy,
sober and honourable body of men.</p>

<hr />

<h2>IMPERIAL INSTITUTORS.</h2>

<p>Sir <span class="sc">F. Abel</span>, the organising Secretary of the Imperial Institute,
recently issued a very agreeable and pleasing memorandum to the
Chairmen of Provincial Committees and others who have assumed an
active part in support of the undertaking. After describing the
&ldquo;large measure of success&rdquo; that has attended the efforts of the local
Committees throughout the country, Sir <span class="sc">Frederick</span> goes on to say
that a &ldquo;considerable number&rdquo; of them have &ldquo;signified their willingness
to prolong their operations with the especial object of
obtaining additions to the &lsquo;Endowment Fund&rsquo; of the Institute which
is about to be created.&rdquo; This is but natural. Taking into consideration
the fact that in many quarters a handsome subscription to the
funds of the Institute has been regarded as a sure passport to
honour, and that the non-distribution of titles right and left among
a lot of small provincial celebrities has already occasioned a good deal
of heartburning and disappointment, this new lease of life, affording
them, as it does, a fresh opportunity of struggling for their much-coveted
prize, cannot but be hailed by the yet unsatisfied &ldquo;Chairmen
of Provincial Committees and others&rdquo; with genuine joy and
thankfulness.</p>

<p>That plain Mr. <span class="sc">John Bopkins</span>, or Mr. <span class="sc">Peter Pickletub</span>, Mayor,
should suddenly blossom out into Sir <span class="sc">John Bopkins</span>, and, possibly,
Sir <span class="sc">Peter Pickletub</span>, Bart., would only seem to those indefatigable
gentlemen an appropriate finish to their labours in furtherance of
the interests of the Institute. Their readiness, therefore, to prolong
their operations, as it may be measured by the fact that it will have
the special object not only of &ldquo;procuring additions&rdquo; to the Endowment
Fund, but also of tacking them on to their own names, is likely
to be both hearty and enthusiastic. Whether anything will come of
their hopeful perseverance, remains to be seen; but it is tolerably
certain that if some sort of bureau for the sale of decorations, after
the latest French model, could be instituted on this side of the
Channel, there would be no lack of clients ready to besiege it.
But&mdash;&mdash;we manage these things much better in England.</p>

<hr />

<p>When the Deputation waited on him, Mr. <span class="sc">Matthews</span> was the
&ldquo;Not-at-Home Secretary.&rdquo; Quite right too.</p>

in no case be returned, not even when accompanied by a Stamped and Addressed Envelope, Cover, or Wrapper. To this rule

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
